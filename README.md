# web3.recruitmenttask



This is the code I have done for the recruitment task of web3 project under pclub. I have written the code in c++ .
First of all i understood the concept of OOPS from the internet . As i had prior knowledge of structure in c so i easily grasped the concepts and then did the code as per it was mentioned.
